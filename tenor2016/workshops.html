            <h5>Content</h5>
            This workshop will center around the question as to how to control a powerful generative music application from within a music notation environment. The focus will be on DJster, a port of Clarence Barlow's legacy software AUTOBUSK. Following the original design concept, DJster exists in two flavours which have been implemented in plain Max as well as Max for Live: a Live device for real-time generation of musical events and a "Scorepion" (a plugin for MaxScore) for non-real generation aiming for the notation of musical structures to compose with. The two implementations are capable of sharing presets allowing users to set and tweak parameters in the Live device, and to export those settings to the composition/notation environment. During the workshop I will explain the technology behind DJster, give an introduction to both implementations and discuss practical applications for experimental, microtonal and film music composition. 
            
            <h5>Organizer</h5>
				<div class=organisera>
				<span class="wsorg">Georg Hajdu</span><br /> 
				Hajdu, born in Göttingen, Germany, is among the first composers of his generation dedicated to the combination of music, science and computer technology. After studies in Cologne and at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT), he received his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. In 1996, following residencies at IRCAM and the ZKM, Karlsruhe, he co-founded the ensemble WireWorks. In 1999, he produced his full-length opera Der Sprung. In May 2002, his Internet performance environment Quintet.net was employed in a Munich Biennale opera performance. He co-founded the European Bridges Ensemble for networked music performance in 2005 and organized several editions of the Music in the Global Village Conference (Budapest, 2007 and 2008) as well as the first conference entirely dedicated to the Bohlen-Pierce scale (Boston, 2010).<br />

				In addition to his compositions, which are characterized by a pluralistic attitude and have earned him several international prizes, the IBM-prize of the Ensemble Modern among them, Georg Hajdu published articles on several topics on the borderline of music and science. His areas of interest include multimedia, microtonality, algorithmic, interactive and networked composition. As software designer he has created tools for musicians including the music notation software MaxScore (co-developed with New York guitarist and composer Nick Didkovsky).<br />

				Georg Hajdu is professor of multimedia composition at the Hamburg University of Music and Theatre and founding director of the Center for Microtonal Music and Multi-Media (ZM4).

			 <div class="wsitem">Source code and music notation both seek to provide expressive and
				efficient specifications that define the behaviour of systems or agents
				over time - be they computers or musicians - for subsequent live,
				interactive, or repeatable execution. This workshop looks at the creative
				and pedagogical opportunities for notations that draw on and bridge both
				programming and musical practices and ontologies. Exploration and
				experimentation is supported by the Manhattan music coding environment
				(Nash, 2014), which combines a text-based pattern sequencer notation with
				spreadsheet formula-style code expressions, enabling a continuum of
				musical expression from traditional/manual note arranging to increasingly
				algorithmic and generative configurations. With the aid of Sam Aaron,
				other technologies that bridge programming and music, such as Sonic Pi,
				will also be considered and explored.</div>

				<span class="time">12:45</span> – <span class="wsshort">Opening Remarks (30m, Chris Nash & Sam Aaron)</span>
				<div class="wsitem">Audio/visual presentation with live software examples (e.g. Manhattan, Sonic Pi, Excel, Logic, Max/MSP), highlighting concepts, notations and usability issues in digital music practices or programming language design.</div>

            <h5>Content</h5>
            This workshop has been designed to investigate the theory and practice of Animated Music Notation, and will be divided into four sections. The purpose of Section 1 is to provide an historical and technological context, as well as a general introduction to contemporary animated scoring practices and animated music notation. In Section 2, a taxonomy of high-level and low-level animated score functionalities and symbols will be posited in order to provide a consistent terminology with which to approach animated scores in theory and practice. In Section 3, attendees will be encouraged to participate in a series of hands-on explorations of a variety of animated score functionalities, and in Section 4, a theory of animated music notation will be presented simultaneously with an extension of the hands-on practices experienced in Section 3. Each Section has been designed to encourage discussion throughout and upon their completion. Workshop attendees are strongly encouraged to bring instruments, although this is by no means necessary.
